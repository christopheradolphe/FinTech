# FinTech Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of side projects and experiments within the FinTech space. The primary goal is to deepen understanding of foundational techniques, tools, and models that underpin modern financial technology applications.

Each project is designed to be self-contained, reproducible, and serve as a stepping stone toward more advanced applications in algorithmic trading, investment research, and financial risk management.
